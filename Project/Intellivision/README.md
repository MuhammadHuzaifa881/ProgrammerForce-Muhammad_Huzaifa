•	What is CRM?
CRM stands for Customer Relationship Management. The goal of CRM is to improve customer retention, enhance customer satisfaction, and drive sales growth. 
Our task is to create a CRM model website using HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap.

•	Pages Of our Website:

o	Login Page:
The Login page will have two options. Either to register as a new user or to login to website.

=>	Login Option:
Our website will start from a login page. If the user clicks on the Login Button, then the user will be directed to Login form. Login form will be having option to write the e-mail and password. We will give the submit button to allow us to login to our home page (Dashboard). We will also give an option for Forget password which will direct us to another Form having options to either recover password by giving more details.

=>	Register as New User:
If the user clicks on the Register button, then the user will be directed to a registration form. In this form the User must provide all his information and details to make a new account. By making a new account, the user can register the website and login to the home page (Dashboard).

o	Dashboard page:
The dashboard page is going to be the home page of our website. In this page, we will be showing all our basic information and updates. This page will contain all the statistical information of the website.

=>	Data List:
We will show the data list on the dashboard page. Will give the option to edit or delete data from the list. If the user clicks on the edit, we will direct the user to another page there, he can edit and make changes with the data given in the table. When the user saves the changes, the updates will be shown in the main dashboard page.
	If the User clicks on the delete option, then the browser will show pop up message for confirmation. If the user confirms the delete, then the selected data in the table will be deleted and removed from the dashboard page.

o	Configuration Page:
We will create a separate configuration page to store our configuration form. In this Form, we will be saving all the API's. We will also give an Export button and by pressing that button we should be able to save the API data in PDF form.


o	Settings page:
In this page, we are going to show different setting options and permissions. Admin can give permissions to the users who can have Full access to the website. Or admin can restrict the permissions to the users so the user will be allowed only limited access.
